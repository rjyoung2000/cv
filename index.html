  <p> I started working in the data storage industry in 1978 and has worked at several different
    storage companies in various capacities. I have been in manufacturing, manufacturing
    process engineering, Development engineering, Servo Trackwriter,
    Program Management, Failure Analysis, and Customer Support. I spent several years involved
    with the overseas operations and startup of manufacturing sites in Singapore, Indonesia,
    China, and Japan. A lot of activities included training operators,
    technicians, engineers, and management on equipment setup, operation, calibration, and usage of manufacturing devices. I had to work with management to write operating procedures that satisfied ISO 9001 specification. I worked for several years
    in the area of failure analysis supporting such large companies like <a href="https://www.dell.com">Dell</a>, HP, <a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, as well as Disty companies like Best Buy and Costco to support failed drive returns. This
    also involved working with the factories and engineering departments
    to have corrective actions put in place for specific failure modes. A couple of notable failure modes were: solving a contamination issue that saved Maxtor over $25 Million in drive returns and helping Apple solve a resonance issue with their
    newest Mac Pro computer – which forced them to redesign their computer.</p>
